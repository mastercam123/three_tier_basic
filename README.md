
# Basic Application Development 

This project will created a 3-Tier Application which will be deployed in AWS Cloud Environment.
The Purpose of this small project is to get hands-on experience regarding web application development. In this project, many of the tasks are done in a very pragmatic way, to let the contributor to build a simple application using developed technologies.




## Three-Tier Application Architecture

A common architectural example that implements best practices for Application Layer which breaks an Application into three layers:

- Presentation layer => a public accessible layer that exposes to the internet

- Application layer => this layer containes computing and private API that routes requests from the presentation layer to the database layer.

- Database layer => this layer containes business critical-services such as relational or non-relational database.

The architecture will be looked like below diagram.

The development will be divided mainly into three main areas:
1. Frontend
2. Backend + Database
3. Infrastructure

# This is a project to have a good learning experience for everyone with interest in application development. Don't be scared to make mistakes.
## Frontend Development
In this area you will develop a static website for the development as well as deploying an authentication service.
The technologies you might use:
- React (JavaScript or TypeScript)
- Angular
- Authentication Service e.g : AWS Cognito, JWT
- HTML
- CSS
- Git, Github
## Backend and Database Development
In this area you will develop backend services (API and Database).
The technologies you might use:
- Python (FastAPI or Flask)
- Javascript (NodeJS)
- REST API
- Relational Database (PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- Non relational Database (MongoDB or Cassandra)
- JWT
- Git, Github
- Docker

## Infrastructure Development
In this area you will develop infrastructure in the AWS Cloud.
The technologies you might use:
- Terraform or CloudFormation
- Github Action
- CI/CD Pipeline
- Bash scripting
- Linux
- AWS services
